# Welcome

{% hint style="danger" %}
Signal.js will be sunsetting on October 26th, along with our [general infrastructure restructuring](https://app.gitbook.com/s/ba0VvgtFt5bQ1nMX8XVR/). The package will be removed from npm as well as the documentation. If you would like to keep using Signal.js after this date, you may use the [archived source code](https://archives.equestria.dev/cgit/signal.js), which also includes documentation.
{% endhint %}

Welcome to Signal.js, documentation is coming soon
